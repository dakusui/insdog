<body><h1 id="future-works">Future Works</h1>
<p>In this section, we discuss potential development items for the
future. Any of them is commited to be developed as of now until a ticket
for it is filed in the community.</p>
<h2 id="splitting-modules">Splitting Modules</h2>
<p>Right now, <strong>InsDog</strong> contains only one module:
<code>insdog-all</code>, which depends on <strong>Playwright for
Java</strong>. However, this is not necessarily always required. Only
when you are testing web application UIs, it will be needed.</p>
<p>In the future, we will have the following submodules on top of
<code>insdog-all</code>, which always contains all of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>framework</code></li>
<li><code>webui</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe we have more modules such as <code>grpc</code>,
<code>rest</code>, <code>python</code>, etc.</p>
<h2 id="multi-language-support">Multi-Language Support</h2>
<p>JVM (<strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong>) can run programs written
in any bytecode compilable languages. So, without modifying any single
line of codes in the framework, you can run tests written in
<strong>Kotlin</strong>, for instance. But it will require a bit tedious
job if we try other languages such as <strong>Python</strong> to
abstract its language characteristics. Rather than having our users
write adapters, it may be a good idea to bundle a helper class in
<strong>InsDog</strong> itself.</p>
<h2 id="api-test-support">API test support</h2>
<p>Similar to multi-language support, users of <strong>InsDog</strong>
can develop their own base classes and utilities for API testing for
protocols such as <code>gRPS</code>, <code>REST</code>, etc., by
themselves. It would be repetitive and tedious job. It will be a good
idea to integrate basic supports for API tests of popular protocols is a
good idea.</p>
<h2 id="reverse-execution-mode">Reverse Execution Mode</h2>
<p>This is the third execution mode, where actions specified by
<code>@AutotestExecution#defaultExecution(): @Spec#value</code> is
executed but in the reversed order unless it breaks the constraint
defined by <code>@DependsOn</code> and <code>@When</code>.</p>
<p>This will be useful to find bugs in the product that can be revealed
only by the order of executions. If you are interested in the basis
(theory) of this idea, check Chapter 10 “Sequence-Covering Arrays” of
“Introduction to Combinatorial Testing” by D. Richard Kuhn, Raghu N.
Kacker, and Yu Lei (CRC Press).</p>
