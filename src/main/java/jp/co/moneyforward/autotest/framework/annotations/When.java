///
/// A test dependency controlling annotation.
///
/// This annotation is read by the framework only when the `PlanningStrategy#DEPENDENCY_BASED` is activated and usually attached to methods for test results checking.
/// This annotation can be attached to an action method (a `Scene` returning method).
///
/// Even if the method to which this annotation is attached is not included in the explicit test scenario, it will be
/// executed as long as its target method (specified by `value()` attribute of this annotation) is a part of the main test scenario.
///
/// The scene created by the attached method will be executed right after the target method.
///
/// if there are following methods:
///
/// ````java
///
/// @Named
/// @DependsOn("login")
/// Scene targetMethod() {
///   return scene;
/// }
///
/// @Named
/// @When("targetMethod")
/// Scene checkMethod() {
///    return scene;
/// }
/// ````
///
/// And in case only `targetMethod` is specified as a part of the main test scenario, the `checkMethod` will still be executed
/// right after `targetMethod`.
/// The same dependency declaration as the `targetMethod` will be used for the `checkMethod`, too.
///
/// Even if the target method is executed because it is depended on by others during the **beforeAll** step, the `@When` annotated method won't be executed.
/// This behavior is useful when a programmer wants to focus on a specific part of a test and save time.
/// In other words, the scenes from `@When` annotated methods are optional and controlled by the framework.
///
/// This and `@DependsOn` annotations are used mutually exclusively.
