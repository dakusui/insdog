# Requirements

Requirements that `bravo` must satisfy are listed and discussed here.

In the past, requirements for the product have not been managed and structured in a formal way.
From now on (Apr/2024), let's file a ticket for every new requirement item for the product.

When we notice there is a requirement item for which a ticket should have been filed, let's file it.

A JIRA space for it is found [here](https://jira.for.bravo.requirements).
