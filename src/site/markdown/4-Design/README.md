# Design Goals
By replacing "daken-kun"(駄犬くん)

- Provide Uniformed Automated Testing Experience throughout "End-to-end" and API testings.
- Remove "Manual Testing Pain" from QA people (to be discussed its detail more)
- C/I C/D friendly

(t.b.d.)

# Design Principles
(t.b.d.)

Will not try to introduce "syntax sugars".
It leaves to `jq-front`, which enables concise notation in JSON, and `yq`, which allows us to convert `YAML` into `JSON`.
